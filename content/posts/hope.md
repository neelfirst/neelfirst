A lot of hopelessness, I think, comes from amnesia.<br>
The past helps us understand the future.

Somebody said, “What’s the best thing I can do as an individual?”<br>
And... he said, “Stop being an individual.”

I think we’re beginning to recognize that individualism is lonely and we have a deep crisis of loneliness
that Silicon Valley, pandemics, et cetera, have made worse... the solution is community, being a part of a community,
finding a community, supporting community... I think that people deeply want to be part of something larger. 

Capitalism wants us to be consumers, not citizens.<br>
A citizen is part of something bigger.<br>
A citizen is a participant in public life.
