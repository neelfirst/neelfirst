<!-- my dear friend<br>
i have loved<br>
sharing this earth<br>
with you

before i go<br>
i just want to ask<br>
for one thing

i know it feels like<br>
you're living in<br>
dark times<br>
right now

and all you want to do<br>
is light a candle<br>
or a fire

but i want you<br>
to try something<br>
for me<br>
please

turn out the lights<br>
put out the fires<br>
and go outside<br>
in the dark

and when you look up<br>
instead of searching<br>
through every<br>
last<br>
star

look at the blackness<br>
that binds all the light together<br>
and remember<br>
with your heart

that's where you'll find me -->
