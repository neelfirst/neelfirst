Why do the houses stand  
When they that built them are gone;  
When remaineth even of one  
That lived there and loved and planned  
Not a face, not an eye, not a hand,  
Only here and there a bone?  
Why do the houses stand  
When they who built them are gone?  

Oft in the moonlighted land  
When the day is overblown,  
With happy memorial moan  
Sweet ghosts in a loving band  
Roam through the houses that stand–  
For the builders are not gone.
